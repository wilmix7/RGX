Cloud computing   requires  internet  connection   where client   requires

more   speed  in  webpage  loads.. SO  JWEB is  not focused  for JAVA/j2ee.

JWEb  is focused for  JAVA1.0.

JAVA/j2ee   and it's latest technologies  has  massive  amount of files

and  which  take  more  time   to load webpages  in internet  in case

of cloud computing.  SO RGX is used  instead  of JAVA/j2ee.

It's Good   JAVA is  popular  in  webpage application  but not in cloud.
