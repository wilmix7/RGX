Cloud computing   requires  internet  connection   where client   requires

more   speed  in  webpage  loads.. so  Remotewebapplication  run by  remote  server  is  focused.


JWEb  is focused for  JAVA/j2ee  but less  security  in  JWEB.

what  are  most  disadvantages  in java/j2ee?
=====================================================

a) JAVA/j2ee   and it's latest technologies  has  massive  amount of files

and  which  take  more  time   to load webpages  in internet  in case

of cloud computing.  SO RGX is used  instead  of JAVA/j2ee.

It's Good   JAVA is  popular  in  webpage application.

b) Using  JAVA decompiler  JAD  JAVA class  will be  converted to  source code..

So any  class  can  be  converted to source  code..

is  a  greatest   disadvantage  in java  with JDollar-sharp will   take  care..

b) JAVA  language  has  fluent  english  statements can  be  easily  read

by hackers.

So  in  case  of security side  JAVA/j2ee  technology did not fit;

THAT's  why JAVA1.0  is  introduced  by me   at year  2015.
