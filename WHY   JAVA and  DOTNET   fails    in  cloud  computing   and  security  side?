Why   JAVA   should  not be  used  in security side  and cloud computing?

why  they  are   very  worst  software?


Java  software   should not  be used  in cloud  computing

since   they  are  good  only  for  software not used  for security   purpose.

So  using  JAD   JAVA  code  can be   easily  taken;

While  using  code  reflector  Dotnet code  can  easily  taken.

Dotnet is  less weak  in security  side  than  java.

So  where   is high security on both  the  sides...

There  is no need  to bother about it   since   

all DATA is  stored  in  WDBAJ$ cloud database  in Galaxy cloud os.

But   JAVA  is very  less   secure than   Dotnet.

even though it  generates  class files  hacker can  steal  java  class

and analyze  where  .Wdba data is stored.

So   JAVA   software  is  not allowed  for cloud computing.  


WHY  windows   is  used   for  normal purpose...

Since   windows   is  written  on  dotnet  software    it  can  be  easily   hacked....

mostly   GALAXY cloud os  is  designed  to keep safe all   Windows  

WDBAJ$  or  WNOSQL  data. So  this    two   database  is most   important   for

software  and  cloud computing.
