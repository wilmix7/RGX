Why   JAVA  and  Dotnet   should  not be  used  in security side  and cloud computing?

why  they  are   very  worst  software?


Dotnet  software  and  java  software   should not  be used  in cloud  computing

since   they  are  good  only  for  software not used  for security   purpose.

So  using  JAD   JAVA  code  can be   easily  taken;

While  using  code  reflector  Dotnet code  can  easily  taken.

So  where   is  security on both  the  sides...


So Dotnet   and   JAVA   software  is  not allowed  for cloud computing.  


WHY  windows   is  used   for  normal purpose...

Since   windows   also be   written  on  dotnet  software    it  can  be  easily   hacked....
